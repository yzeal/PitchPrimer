# Japanese Pitch Accent Trainer - Development Notes

## 📝 IMPORTANT: How to Write Summary Notes for Chat Interface

**CRITICAL:** When writing summaries in this file that will be shared via chat interface:
- **NEVER use triple backticks (```)** - they close code blocks prematurely in chat
- Use **4-space indentation** for code examples instead
- Use **single backticks (`)` for inline code only
- Use **markdown headers and lists** for structure
- This prevents formatting issues when copying between computers via chat

## 🎵 AUDIO FORMAT & CONVERSION SETUP

### Recommended Audio Format for Unity Cross-Platform:
**Format:** WAV (16-bit, Mono, 44.1kHz)
- ✅ Unity native support on all platforms (PC, Mac, iOS, Android)
- ✅ Uncompressed quality for optimal pitch analysis
- ✅ No licensing issues (unlike MP3)
- ✅ Fast loading for real-time analysis
- ✅ File size: ~2.6MB per minute

### FFmpeg Commands for MP4 → WAV Conversion:

**Basic extraction (preserves original quality):**

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 1 output.wav

**Optimized for speech analysis (with frequency filtering):**

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 1 -af "highpass=f=80,lowpass=f=800" output.wav

**Batch conversion for multiple files:**

**PowerShell (recommended):**

    Get-ChildItem *.mp4 | ForEach-Object { ffmpeg -i $_.Name -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 1 ($_.BaseName + ".wav") }

**CMD/Batch (.bat file):**

    for %%f in (*.mp4) do ffmpeg -i "%%f" -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 1 "%%~nf.wav"

**PowerShell with progress display:**

    $files = Get-ChildItem *.mp4
    $total = $files.Count
    $current = 0
    foreach ($file in $files) {
        $current++
        Write-Host "Processing $current/$total : $($file.Name)"
        ffmpeg -i $file.Name -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 1 ($file.BaseName + ".wav")
    }

**PowerShell with frequency filtering (optimized for Japanese speech):**

    Get-ChildItem *.mp4 | ForEach-Object { 
        $outputName = $_.BaseName + ".wav"
        ffmpeg -i $_.Name -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 1 -af "highpass=f=80,lowpass=f=800" $outputName
    }

**Parameter explanations:**
- `-vn` → No video track
- `-acodec pcm_s16le` → 16-bit WAV format
- `-ar 44100` → 44.1kHz sample rate
- `-ac 1` → Mono (saves 50% file size)
- `-af "highpass=f=80,lowpass=f=800"` → Speech frequency filter (80-800Hz)

### Unity Import Settings for Japanese Audio:
- **Load Type:** Decompress On Load (for real-time analysis)
- **Compression Format:** PCM (uncompressed)
- **Quality:** 100%
- **Force To Mono:** Enabled
- **Sample Rate Setting:** Preserve Sample Rate

### Audio Output Device Selection:
**NOTE:** Unity does not support audio output device selection - always uses system default device. This is a Unity limitation, not a project issue. For testing convenience, users need to set their preferred audio device at the system level before starting the application.

# Japanese Pitch Accent Trainer - Refactoring Progress Summary

## Projekt-Überblick
Unity 6.1 Projekt für japanische Aussprache-Training mit Fokus auf Pitch-Akzent und Rhythmus durch Chorusing-Übungen (gleichzeitiges Sprechen mit nativen Aufnahmen).

## LATEST UPDATE - Day 10: Fixed Audio Recording Distortion 🎙️✨

### ✅ MAJOR BUGFIX: Resolved Microphone Conflict & Audio Distortion
**CRITICAL ISSUE SOLVED:** Fixed severe audio distortion in user recordings caused by dual microphone access
- **Root cause identified:** Both MicAnalysisRefactored and UserAudioRecorder were accessing microphone simultaneously
- **Microphone conflict resolution:** Implemented single-master architecture with shared audio streaming
- **Audio quality restored:** Recordings now crystal clear without distortion or gaps
- **Visualization working:** User cubes now respond properly to voice input during recording

#### Problem Analysis:
**BEFORE (Broken):** Dual microphone access causing resource conflicts

    MicAnalysisRefactored: Microphone.Start(device, ...) // Master microphone
    UserAudioRecorder: Microphone.Start(device, ...)     // CONFLICT! Second access
    Result: Distorted audio, failed recordings, cube visualization broken

**AFTER (Fixed):** Single master with continuous audio streaming

    MicAnalysisRefactored: Microphone.Start(device, ...) // Single master
    UserAudioRecorder: Subscribes to OnRawAudioData event  // Clean audio stream
    Result: Perfect audio quality, working visualization, no conflicts

### ✅ ARCHITECTURE BREAKTHROUGH: Continuous Audio Capture System
**TECHNICAL INNOVATION:** Implemented frame-by-frame continuous audio capture for high-quality recording
- **Every-frame capture:** CaptureContinuousAudio() runs each Update() instead of analysis intervals
- **Gap elimination:** No more 0.1s gaps between audio chunks  
- **Unprocessed raw data:** UserAudioRecorder receives pure microphone stream before any filtering
- **Maintained pitch analysis:** Separate AnalyzePitch() continues every 0.1s for visualization

#### Continuous Capture Implementation in MicAnalysisRefactored:

    void Update()
    {
        if (isAnalyzing && audioSource != null && audioSource.isPlaying)
        {
            // NEW: Continuous audio capture (every frame)
            if (enableContinuousAudioCapture)
            {
                CaptureContinuousAudio(); // 🎯 Key innovation: frame-by-frame capture
            }
            
            // EXISTING: Pitch analysis (every 0.1s)
            if (Time.time - lastAnalysisTime >= analysisInterval)
            {
                AnalyzePitch();
                lastAnalysisTime = Time.time;
            }
        }
    }

#### High-Quality Audio Streaming:

    private void CaptureContinuousAudio()
    {
        int currentPosition = Microphone.GetPosition(deviceName);
        
        // Handle position wrap-around
        if (currentPosition < lastContinuousPosition)
        {
            lastContinuousPosition = 0;
        }
        
        // Capture all new samples since last frame
        if (currentPosition > lastContinuousPosition)
        {
            int sampleCount = currentPosition - lastContinuousPosition;
            float[] newSamples = new float[sampleCount];
            
            // Get raw microphone data
            microphoneClip.GetData(newSamples, lastContinuousPosition);
            
            // 🎯 CRITICAL: Send continuous, unprocessed audio stream
            OnRawAudioData?.Invoke(newSamples);
            
            lastContinuousPosition = currentPosition;
        }
    }

### ✅ ENHANCED USER AUDIO RECORDER: Clean Event-Based Architecture
**SIMPLIFIED & ROBUST:** UserAudioRecorder now purely event-driven with no microphone management
- **Event-only audio:** Receives pristine audio via OnRawAudioData events
- **No microphone conflicts:** Zero direct microphone API calls
- **Continuous recording:** Frame-by-frame audio capture ensures no data loss
- **Metadata collection:** Still collects pitch data for future analysis features

#### Streamlined UserAudioRecorder Implementation:

    // Event-based audio reception (no microphone management)
    private void OnRawAudioDataReceived(float[] audioData)
    {
        if (!isRecording || audioData == null) return;
        
        // Add continuous audio stream to buffer
        audioBuffer.AddSamples(audioData);
        
        // Debug logging every second
        if (enableDebugLogging && Time.frameCount % 60 == 0)
        {
            DebugLog($"📊 Recording audio from shared source: {audioBuffer.CurrentSize} samples");
        }
    }

#### No Update() Method Needed:

    // REMOVED: No Update() needed - pure event-driven
    // void Update() { ... } // Not needed anymore!
    
    // REMOVED: No microphone management
    // private bool StartMicrophoneRecording() { ... } // Conflict source removed
    // private void RecordRealMicrophoneAudio() { ... } // No longer needed

### ✅ PROVEN SOLUTION: Single Master Audio Architecture
**DESIGN PATTERN SUCCESS:** Established robust pattern for shared hardware resource management
- **Single responsibility:** MicAnalysisRefactored = microphone master
- **Multiple consumers:** UserAudioRecorder, ChorusingManager, future systems all use events
- **Clean separation:** Analysis logic separate from recording logic
- **No resource conflicts:** Hardware accessed by one system only

#### Complete Audio Flow Architecture:

## Day 9 Morning: Pitch Range Filter & Deprecation System 🔍

### ✅ NEW FEATURE: Advanced Pitch Range Filter System
**NOISE ELIMINATION:** Added sophisticated pitch frequency filtering to complement existing noise gate
- **Fan noise elimination:** High-frequency sounds (>600Hz) automatically filtered out
- **Low-frequency filtering:** Very low pitches (<60Hz) also filtered as non-voice
- **Two-stage filtering:** Noise Gate (volume-based) + Pitch Filter (frequency-based)
- **Real-time statistics:** Track filter effectiveness and performance

#### Technical Implementation in MicAnalysisRefactored:

    [Header("Pitch Range Filter")]
    [SerializeField] private bool enablePitchRangeFilter = true;
    [Tooltip("Minimum acceptable pitch in Hz (below this = noise)")]
    [SerializeField] private float minAcceptablePitch = 60f; // Lower than typical human voice
    [Tooltip("Maximum acceptable pitch in Hz (above this = noise like fans)")]
    [SerializeField] private float maxAcceptablePitch = 600f; // Higher than typical human voice
    [SerializeField] private bool debugPitchFilter = false; // Separate pitch filter debugging

#### Smart Filtering Logic:

    private PitchDataPoint ApplyPitchRangeFilter(PitchDataPoint originalData)
    {
        if (!enablePitchRangeFilter || !originalData.HasPitch)
            return originalData; // No filtering needed
        
        // Check if pitch is within acceptable range
        bool isInRange = originalData.frequency >= minAcceptablePitch && 
                        originalData.frequency <= maxAcceptablePitch;
        
        if (!isInRange)
        {
            // Return modified data point with no pitch (filtered out)
            return new PitchDataPoint(originalData.timestamp, 0f, 0f, originalData.audioLevel);
        }
        
        return originalData; // Pitch is acceptable
    }

### ✅ INTELLIGENT CONFIGURATION: Voice Type Presets
**EASY SETUP:** Programmatic configuration for different voice types and use cases
- **Preset voice ranges:** Male, Female, Child, General Speech
- **Runtime adjustment:** Can change filter settings during analysis
- **Validation system:** Automatic range validation and warnings

#### Voice Type Presets:

    public void SetPitchRangeForVoiceType(string voiceType)
    {
        switch (voiceType.ToLower())
        {
            case "male":
                SetPitchRange(80f, 300f);     // Typical male voice range
                break;
            case "female":
                SetPitchRange(120f, 400f);    // Typical female voice range
                break;
            case "child":
                SetPitchRange(200f, 600f);    // Higher child voice range
                break;
            case "speech":
                SetPitchRange(60f, 500f);     // General speech range
                break;
        }
    }

- **Current workflow completion:** Start Chorusing → User practice → Record → Stop recording → File saved ✅
- **New workflow extension:** File saved → Scoring analysis → Scoring screen → Again/Next options

#### Planned Scoring Flow:

    UserAudioRecorder.OnRecordingSaved event triggers:
    1. ChorusingManager.StopChorusing() - Clean exit from chorusing state
    2. ScoringManager.StartScoring(userRecordingPath) - Initialize scoring analysis  
    3. GameStateManager.TransitionToState(GameState.Scoring) - Switch UI to scoring screen
    4. ScoringUI displays: Native clip visualization (top) + User clip visualization (bottom)
    5. User interaction: Play/Stop buttons for both clips + Again/Next navigation

### 🏗️ PLANNED ARCHITECTURE: Single-Scene State Management
**DESIGN DECISION:** GameStateManager with Canvas switching instead of multiple scenes
- **Rationale:** Avoids scene transition delays, preserves shared components, smoother audio transitions
- **State enum:** MainMenu, Chorusing, Scoring, Settings
- **Canvas management:** Hide/show different UI canvases based on current state
- **Component coordination:** ScoringManager works with existing ChorusingManager and UserAudioRecorder

#### Planned Components:

    GameStateManager:
    - Canvas chorusingCanvas, scoringCanvas
    - ChorusingManager chorusingManager
    - ScoringManager scoringManager (NEW)
    - TransitionToState(GameState newState)
    - Clean enter/exit state management
